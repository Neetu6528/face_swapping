# face_swapping
- About
In this project, we aim to develop a system that performs face detection and swapping between two images. The application allows users to upload two images, automatically detects faces within these images, and provides the functionality to swap faces between them.

- Libraries
    
    In this project we are using these libraries :-
    
    - `tkinter` and its components for creating and managing the GUI.
    - `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) components for image operations.
    - `cv2` from OpenCV for image processing, including face detection.
    - `numpy` for handling image data as arrays.
